I am currently an Assistant Teaching Professor of [Computer Science at
Iowa State University](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/tancreti).

I completed my PhD at Purdue University under the supervision of
[Professor Saurabh Bagchi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sbagchi/) while working
in the [DCSL](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/) laboratory.
My primary area of research was dependability and security of sensor networks.
